# BEW 1.1. Contractor Project - Charity Tracker

## Scenario:

Imagine you meet a new potential client at a cafe. You know the client is a tax preparer and you don’t know what they are going to pitch you. 

It turns out, they are concerned for their clients who give to charity but by the end of the year haven’t been able to keep track of all the charities they’ve given to. They are also concerned with their clients:
- Giving to the best, or highly rated charities
- Seeing the impact of what causes they give to
- Overall people giving to charity more

They contract you to build a web application that at least keeps track of what donations a user has made to charities but could also achieve another of their goals above.

### Requirements:

- [x] Drawn wireframes
- [x] Drawn ERD
